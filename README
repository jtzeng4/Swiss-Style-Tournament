To use the program, there are two different files: tournament.sql and tournament.py. Tournament.sql contains the database definitions that must be initialized before use. Tournament.py has the functions in order to get the program to work.


After tournament.sql is initialized, tournament.py must be initialized to be able to use all the functions. Tournament.py has different functions: connect, deleteMatches, deletePlayers, countPlayers, registerPlayer, playerStandings, reportMatch, swissPairings.
connect: connects to the tournament database.
deleteMatches: removes all match records from database
deletePlayers: removes all player records from database
countPlayers: returns the number of players registered
registerPlayer: adds a player to tournament database, needs a name input and the database will give it a id number.
playerStandings: returns a list of the players and their win records sorted by number of wins.
reportMatch: records a match between two players, needs two name inputs.
swissPairings: returns a list of pairs of players that will play in the next round.
